# Disable Text Selection
I have designed a Disable Text Selection in Day 17 challenge in #30DaysOfHtmlCss.

## How can we check that text selection is Disable or not:-
- Verify that the text is not selectable by double clicking
- Verify that the text is not selectable by dragging for a selection

## Tech stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
